# Monopoly
 A (eventually) playable browser version of Monopoly using HTML, CSS and JS. I am a huge fan of Monopoly so this is the ideal pet project to learn with.
 
 While I have a huge amount of experience in HTML and CSS/SCSS, my knowledge of JS is limited and this is my first time using Git. Using this as a learning experience.
