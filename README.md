# Monopoly
A playable browser version of Monopoly using HTML, CSS and JS. I am a huge fan of Monopoly so this is the ideal pet project to learn with.

At the time I started this project I had a huge amount of experience in HTML, CSS and SCSS but my Javascript knowledge was limited and this was my first time using Git. This project was an incredible learning experience for me, and although I look back now and see things that could definitely be improved upon, I remain hugely proud of it.
