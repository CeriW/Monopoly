An incomplete list of all the developments that need to be completed

-------------------------------------------

- Trading

- Bankruptcy

- Mortgaging

- Make it so players can do the following with 'Get out of jail free' cards
    - Own
    - Use
    - Trade
    - Sell

- Jail just visiting

- Refactor all the things with player specific IDs to have player attributes instead.

- Make the tokens reposition when the window is resized.

- Update spaces array with actual rent values

- Check Chance/Community Chest cards - I got this list online but I'm sure some of them aren't from the current UK version.

- Calc cards

- Exchange cards

- Make it come up on the feed when players buy houses. If possible, have it come up with "Player 2 built 3 houses on Bond Street" rather than just coming up every time they hit build.

- Tokens should start off displaying at position 0 on the board.

- A thought to investigate - if you have 1 house on a property in the colour set and 0 houses on another, can you mortgage the property with 0?

- Dice roll to see which player goes first

- Don't have to wait until your turn to build houses/hotels

- Reorder the readme so it's in alphabetical order

- Check whether all the properties on the space array objects are really necessary.


STRETCH GOALS

- Add a Monopoly rulebook

- House rules? (e.g. free parking)

- Players to be able to pick their own colour

- Quick game modes (see original rulebook)
  <input name="Color Picker" type="color"/>
