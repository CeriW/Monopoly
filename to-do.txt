An incomplete list of all the developments that need to be completed

-------------------------------------------

FUNCTIONALITY

- Declare a winner.

- Check Chance/Community Chest cards - I got this list online but I'm sure some of them aren't from the current UK version.

- I know the game isn't designed for small screens, but I can:
    - Add a warning on small screen sizes
    - Rearrange the page for smaller screens, even if it requires wrapping. Grid will probably help with this.

- Warning on auction screen if you're bidding more money than you have.

- Cookies/local storage so you can come back to a game later.

- Ability to click on portfolio item from main board screen. Perhaps a property name tooltip on hover too.

- Player summaries and similar need to have white tokens/text when the colour is too dark.


BUGS SPOTTED

- Player 1 declared bankruptcy. Player 4 goes bankrupt after winning a resulting auction. When I clicked 'initiate trade', the trade was for player 2?


IMPROVEMENTS

- Make the quick start functionality actually good.

- Refactor all the things with player specific IDs to have player attributes instead.

- Reorder the readme so it's in alphabetical order

- update the code throughout to use the createElement function

- Are there any events where I should be using the 'this' keyword? 'this' refers to the event owner.

- Super tax and income tax should probably have costs in their spaces entry, rather than being hard coded to 100/200

- There are a lot of things that should have cursor: pointer on them.


ONGOING THINGS

- Better testing options

- Consider what other keyboard shortcuts might be available.


STRETCH GOALS

- Add a Monopoly rulebook
	- The Monopoly wiki is really good. Include links and/or snippets from here.

- Question mark in popup for user help and more info on rules.
	- Revisit the trade with mortgages window. There's a wall of text with rules in it.

- House rules? (e.g. free parking)

- Players to be able to pick their own colour
<input name="Color Picker" type="color"/>

- Quick game modes (see original rulebook)

- Tooltips on appropriate items

- More tokens https://monopoly.fandom.com/wiki/Tokens

- Multiple international/theme boards

- Use geolocation to determine where players are based, and offer the most closest version of the game (eg. UK, US etc)

- JSON parsing for space/cards

- Use a weather API to display appropriate weather over the welcome screen.

- Share on social media when you win

- Sound effects

- Income Tax to have the option for 10% rather than just Â£200
