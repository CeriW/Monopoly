An incomplete list of all the developments that need to be completed

-------------------------------------------

FUNCTIONALITY

- Visual improvements


BUGS SPOTTED

- Player 1 declared bankruptcy. Player 4 goes bankrupt after winning a resulting auction. When I clicked 'initiate trade', the trade was for player 2?

- Check that money is changing hands properly for cards and rent and bankruptcy etc.

- "Player 1 has built 1 house on Old Kent Road, 1 house on Whitechapel Road, 1 house on Old Kent Road, 1 house on Whitechapel Road, 1 house on Whitechapel Road & 1 house on Whitechapel Road"

- When you unmortgage a property it lets you build houses, even if there are still mortgages elsewhere in the set.



IMPROVEMENTS

- Make the quick start functionality actually good.

- There are a lot of things that should have cursor: pointer on them.

- More colours for tokens


ONGOING THINGS

- Better testing options

- Consider what other keyboard shortcuts might be available.


THINGS TO DO AT THE VERY END

- It would probably be better to combine it all into one massive localStorage item than have loads of them.

- Need to update the share to twitter code

- Reorder the readme so it's in alphabetical order

- Are there any events where I should be using the 'this' keyword? 'this' refers to the event owner.



STRETCH GOALS

- Add a Monopoly rulebook
	- The Monopoly wiki is really good. Include links and/or snippets from here.

- Question mark in popup for user help and more info on rules.
	- Revisit the trade with mortgages window. There's a wall of text with rules in it.

- House rules? (e.g. free parking)

- Quick game modes (see original rulebook)

- Tooltips on appropriate items

- Multiple international/theme boards

- Use geolocation to determine where players are based, and offer the most closest version of the game (eg. UK, US etc)

- Use a weather API to display appropriate weather over the welcome screen.

- Sound effects

- Income Tax to have the option for 10% rather than just Â£200

- Dark mode


COMPLETELY FRIVOLOUS STUFF

- More tokens https://monopoly.fandom.com/wiki/Tokens

- Stats (graphs?)


AFTER GO LIVE

- JSON parsing for space/cards
