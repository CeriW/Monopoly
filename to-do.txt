An incomplete list of all the developments that need to be completed

-------------------------------------------

- If players choose not to buy properties, they must go to auction

- Trading

- Bankruptcy

- Mortgaging

- Make it so players can do the following with 'Get out of jail free' cards
    - Own
    - Use
    - Trade
    - Sell

- Jail just visiting

- Refactor all the things with player specific IDs to have player attributes instead.

- Sell houses/hotels

- Selling hotel shenanigans if there aren't sufficient houses in the bank

- Have to build houses evenly

- Can't build houses/hotels if there aren't any in the bank.

- Update utilities and stations so you can't build houses on them

- Appropriate rent for utilities and stations

- Display houses on the board for properties that have them

- Remove the number 5 on the hotel rent in the property overview window

- Make the tokens reposition when the window is resized.

- When you click a property on the board, bring up the window with its details.

- Update spaces array with actual rent values

- Check Chance/Community Chest cards - I'm sure some of them are wrong.

- Full player portfolio to show house icons rather than just have it in writing.
