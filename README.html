        <h1 id="monopoly">Monopoly</h1>
<p> A (eventually) playable browser version of Monopoly using HTML, CSS and JS. I am a huge fan of Monopoly so this is the ideal pet project to learn with.</p>
<p> While I have a huge amount of experience in HTML and CSS/SCSS, my knowledge of JS is limited and this is my first time using Git. Using this as a learning experience.</p>
