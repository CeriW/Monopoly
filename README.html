          <p> A (eventually) playable browser version of Monopoly using HTML, CSS and JS. I am a huge fan of Monopoly so this is the ideal pet project to learn with.</p>
          <p> While I have a huge amount of experience in HTML and CSS/SCSS, my knowledge of JS is limited and this is my first time using Git. Using this as a learning experience.</p>

      <li>42: money</li>
    </ul>
    There are intended to be empty indices within this array since the index is important, and care is taken when removing items from this array that the other items aren't moved to compensate.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="variable">
  <h3 class="variable-name">communityChestCards / chanceCards</h3>
  <div class="variable-type">array</div>
  <div class="variable-description">
    An array of objects containing all of the community chest/chance cards. These are shuffled at the beginning of the game so order is unimportant.<br>
    Each card object has a number of properties:
    <ul>
      <li>description - <i>string</i> - What the card says on it.</li>
      <li>
        type - <i>string</i> - the classification of card. This can be:
        <ul>
          <li>'+' - a card which gains the player money from the bank. The <i>value</i> property is how much money the player gets.</li>
          <li>'-' - a card for which the player has to surrender money to the bank. The <i>value</i> property is how much money the player forfeits.</li>
          <li>'getout' - a get out of jail free card which is held onto by the player until used, sold or traded. The <i>value</i> property is null as it's not needed.</li>
          <li>'repairs' - a card which requires players to pay an amount depending on how many buildings are on their properties. The <i>value</i> is an array, where the first entry is the amount to be paid per house, and the second the amount to be paid per hotel.</li>
          <li>'exchange' - A card where players have to exchange money. Positive numbers represent how much the player receives from the other players. Negative numbers represent how much the player pays the other players.</li>
          <li>'move' - A card which requires the player to move. When this is the case the <i>value</i> property is the position on the board the player moves to.</value></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>value - <i>number</i> - A number associated with the card. See the description for the 'type' property to see what this number represents.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="variable">
  <h3 class="variable-name">spaces</h3>
  <div class="variable-type">array</div>
  <div class="variable-description">
    An array of objects representing all of the spaces on the board. These objects will have a number of properties depending on what type of property they are:
    <ul>
      <li>name - <i>string</i> - The name of the space as it appears on the board/title deed cards</li>
      <li>type - <i>string</i> - The type of space this is. May be 'special'(corners), 'property', 'community-chest', 'station', 'chance' or 'utility'</li>
      <li>price - <i>number</i> - The price the space costs to buy (property, station and utlities only)</li>
      <li>group - <i>string</i> - the group this property belongs to. Can be a colour, 'train-station' or 'utility'. Null for all others.</li>
      <li>boardposition - <i>string</i> - The area of the board the space lies on. Can be 'north, 'south', 'east' or 'west'.</li>
      <li>position - <i>number</i> - the position on the board. This correlates with the index of the array.</li>
      <li>
        Rent - <i>array</i>
        <br>For properties, this is an array of 7 numbers:
        <ul>
          <li>0 - <i>number</i> - base rent</li>
          <li>1 - <i>number</i> - rent with colour set</li>
          <li>2 - <i>number</i> - rent with one house</li>
          <li>3 - <i>number</i> - rent with two houses</li>

          <li>5 - <i>number</i> - rent with four houses</li>
          <li>6 - <i>number</i> - rent with hotel</li>
        </ul>
        <br> For stations, an array of 4 numbers:
        <ul>
          <li>0 - <i>number</i> - rent when the owner owns one station</li>
          <li>1 - <i>number</i> - rent when the owner owns two stations</li>
          <li>2 - <i>number</i> - rent when the owner owns three stations</li>
          <li>3 - <i>number</i> - rent when the owner owns four stations</li>
        </ul>
        <br>For utilities, an array of 2 items:
        <ul>
          <li>0 - <i>string</i> - the description to show on the title deed card for when a single utility is owned</li>
          <li>0 - <i>string</i> - the description to show on the title deed card for when both utilities are owned</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>houseCost - <i>number</i> - how much it costs to build a house on this property. Only relevant for property spaces. The cost to sell houses is half this amount.</li>
      <li>hotelCost - <i>number</i> - how much it costs to build a hotel on this property. Only relevant for property spaces. The cost to sell hotels is half this amount. I have never seen a Monopoly set where this is different to the house price, but I am including this in case I later discover that there is a board where this is different.</li>
      <li>owner - <i>object</i> - initialised as null, but later is updated to be an object containing the player who owns the property. Note that this object is not kept up to date (the <i>players</i> variable should be used for up to date info) but is included as an object as various non-changing properties are used throughout the code, such as name and id.</li>
      <li>houses - <i>number</i> - how many houses are on this property. Only relevant for property spaces. Note that a value of 5 indicates a hotel.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="variable">
  <h3 class="variable-name">players</h3>
  <div class="variable-type">array</div>
  <div class="variable-description">
    Initialised empty, but later filled with objects for each player. Each object has a number of properties:
    <ul>
      <li>money - <i>number</i> - the amount of money the player has</li>
      <li>id - <i>number</i> - an id number used for the player. This is sometimes used to keep things less confusing since player 1 is 0 in the players array.</li>
      <li>properties - <i>array</i> - starts off empty, but will later be filled with objects representing the properties the player owns. See the <i>spaces</i> variable for details on what these objects look like. Note that this array is not kept up to date, and the <i>spaces</i> array should be used for reference. However it is included here as it is sometimes used for checks on basic info that doesn't change.</li>
      <li>token - <i>string</i> - a string containing which token the player has selected in the new player window. This string will be one of the names from the availableTokens variable. This is used to display the correct token for each player.</li>
      <li>name - <i>string</i> - the name the player chose for themselves in the new player window. If the player didn't pick a name it will default to 'Player 1', 'Player 2' etc.</li>
      <li>position - <i>number</i> - the space on the board the player is on. This will correspond with the position properties of the objects in the <i>spaces</i> array</li>
      <li>getOutCards - <i>array</i> - an array containing the 'Get Out Of Jail cards' the player currently holds. When cards are added to this array, they are removed from their deck. Each card object has a deck property, indicating which deck it should be returned to once used.</li>

<div class="variable">
  <h3 class="variable-name">maxNumberOfPlayers</h3>
  <div class="variable-type">number</div>
  <div class="variable-description">
    A number representing the maximum number of players the game will allow. While the official rules don't give a maximum number of players, there is only a certain amount that is practical, both in terms of the gameplay and displaying in the browser window. This variable makes it easier to adjust the various bits that generate based on the number of players.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="variable">
  <h3 class="variable-name">availableActions</h3>
  <div class="variable-type">object</div>
  <div class="variable-description">
    Contains various properties that determine what can or can't currently be done. These are set as attributes on the body element, which both the JS and CSS use to make certain actions available to players (normally by showing/hiding or disabling buttons):
    <ul>
      <li>rollDice - <i>boolean</i> - whether the dice can currently be rolled.</li>
      <li>endTurn - <i>boolean</i> - whether the current player is currently able to end their turn.</li>
      <li>getOutOfJail - <i>boolean</i> - whether the current player is able to take actions to get themselves out of jail</li>
      <li>rollDoublesForJail - <i>boolean</i> - whether the current player is able to attempt to roll doubles to get themselves out of jail. Players get three attempts at this before they are forced to pay 50 or use a get out of jail free card to get out.</li>
      <li>cardOutOfJail - <i>boolean</i> - whether a 'Get Out Of Jail Free' card may be used to get out of jail, based on whether the current player actually has one</li>
      
      <li>buildHouse - <i>boolean</i> - whether houses can currently be built on properties, based on the number of houses available in the bank</li>
      <li>buildHotel - <i>boolean</i> - whether hotels can currently be built on properties, based on the number of hotels available in the bank</li>
      <li>closePopup - <i>boolean</i> - whether the popup can be closed. This is used in things like auctions where you don't want players to be able to close the popup until things have been concluded.</li>
      <li>mortgageProperty - <i>boolean</i> - whether the player can mortgage a property. </li>
      <li>unmortgageProperty - <i>boolean</i> - whether the player can unmortgage a properrty. </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<div class="variable">
  <h3 class="variable-name">currencySymbol</h3>
  <div class="variable-type">string</div>
  <div class="variable-description">
    A string containing the desired currency symbol. 
  </div>
</div>

<div class="variable">
  <h3 class="variable-name">currencySymbolSpan</h3>
  <div class="variable-type">string</div>
  <div class="variable-description">
    a HTML string containing a span with the currency symbol in. This is necessary as the default 'Monopoly dollars' symbol isn't a standard character, but is almost exactly the same as the ₩ (Korean currency) symbol upside down. CSS is used to rotate this span. If changing this to a different symbol it would be necessary to update the CSS.

      This function runs after the player has clicked 'Trade' with a player in the initial trade window. This function will bring create the full player summaries necessary for proper trade negotiations to take place. It will also create inputs for money to be proposed (with appropriate min/max values based on how much money that player has, and buttons to accept/counter/reject the trade. When clicked, the buttons will run the updateProposal() function.
      <br> Note that throughout this function elements are removed from the array using the Javascript delete function. This leaves empty entries in our array, which isn't normally what you'd want in Javascript but in this instance it is - the index of each item is very important.
